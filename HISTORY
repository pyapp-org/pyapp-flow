0.19.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add SetGlobalVar to set variables current and parent scopes. 


0.18.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add default_vars option to Workflows to apply default values if one is not
  already provided.


0.17.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add required_vars option to Workflows to ensure that required variables
  are set before the workflow is executed.
- Integrate required_vars into CLI.
- Add sensitive filter when outputting variables in flow-trace


0.16.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add ``and_finally`` option to the Group (and derived) nodes. This provides a way
  to execute nodes to clean up after a workflow has completed successfully or
  an exception was raised.

Changes
-------

- testing.call_node now accepts a workflow context. This allows for inspection
  of the context if an exception is raised.
- Fix the inheritance of exceptions. All RunTime exceptions are now based off
  of ``WorkflowRuntimeError``.
- ``TryExcept`` now resolves nodes called after an exception taking subclasses
  into account. This matches the behaviour of Python itself.


0.15.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add TryExcept node to handle errors in a workflow.

Changes
-------

- ForEach node now shows each loop and allows for custom labels
  for each loop.
- Improve indentation of workflow output.



0.14.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add FeatureEnabled node to enable/disable a feature based on a
  PyApp feature-flag.


0.13.0
======

Additions
---------

- Add Group. A group is a set of nodes that are executed but do not
  get placed in a new variable scope. Useful for building blocks of
  nodes.
- Group also includes an option to change the log_level for the duration
  of the group being executed.
- Fatal step has been added to trigger a fatal exception to stop the
  workflow.

Changes
-------

- Nodes now inherits from Group and includes the log_level option.

0.11.0
======

Changes
-------
